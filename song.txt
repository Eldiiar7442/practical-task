I found a love for me
oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found the girl, beatiful and sweet
Oh, never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love, not knowing'
what it was
I will not give you up this time 
Oh Darling just kiss me slow your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you are holding mine
